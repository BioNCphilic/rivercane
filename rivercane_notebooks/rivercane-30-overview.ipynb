    "### Habitat suitability will be compared between two counties in the United States; specifically, Cherokee County, Oklahoma and Jackson County, North Carolina. These areas were chosen because they are inhabited by Cherokee people who use native Rivercane for a variety of cultural purposes. For each location, soil data and elevation will be analyzed and two climate models will be used to look at different predictions for precipitation at the end of the century (2096-2099). The two models chosen were:\n",
